### üñ•Ô∏è Team Project (1st Year C Project)

# Team Project (C)
This project is a shopping automation system. Users can list all products, filter them by categories, brands, or price range, and add selected products to their cart. The cart allows users to view the selected items along with the total price. At the end, users have the opportunity to win a discount by playing a single-round game against the computer. If they win, they receive a random discount between 5% and 30%.
